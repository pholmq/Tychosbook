### PDF OF THE BOOK - in English, German, Dutch and Russian

_February 5, 2024:_ Today I have decided (in the interest of maximum public diffusion) to make the full 320-page PDF of the 2nd Edition of "The TYCHOS - Our Geoaxial Binary System" **freely downloadable**. Enjoy, share and diffuse far & wide. The TYCHOS research is an ongoing enterprise I have pursued non-stop for over a decade - with no academic / institutional funding whatsoever. It is a work in progress and much remains to be done, such as the continuing development of the Tychosium 3D simulator (headed by my closest collaborator Patrik Holmqvist) and the translation of the book in various languages.

### UPCOMING TYCHOS EVENTS

- **Oct 31 - Nov 2, 2024**: It is now confirmed that I will be presenting the TYCHOS model at the 3-day ["Renewal Of Science" conference](https://www.renewalofculture.org/renewalofscience) to be held at the COMPUTER HISTORY MUSEUM in Mountain View, California. To all my American friends and followers, I dearly hope to see you all there. I will be speaking **at around 1:30pm on Friday, November 1** and am currently working on a refined slideshow presentation of the TYCHOS model. Here is the [agenda of the conference](https://www.renewalofculture.org/_files/ugd/01c972_96547b8280094e09896e1b34560aac88.pdf). 

- **March 21, 22 & 23 2025 / Stockholm, Malmö & Gothenburg.** Simon Shack and Patrik Holmqvist will be presenting the TYCHOS model in Sweden's three largest cities. Details of the 'Mini-Tychos-Tour' of Sweden will be available soon. For enquries, feel free to contact me via e-mail at simonshack@libero.it (The dates are confirmed and I have already booked my Italy-Sweden return flights).

### MISCELLANEOUS UPDATES

> **WEBSITE UPDATED ! (May 2024)**
> _May 4, 2024:_ This is to announce that I have now updated the website with the final (proofread, polished and revised) versions of all 32 chapters of the Tychos book, just as they are to be found in the hardcover book available at LULU (see above). This also means that you can now easily reference / hyperlink any given subchapter sections of your interest, since they all have their individual URL. Of course, one of the main purposes of this website is to stimulate online discussions about the Tychos model, something that this new feature should facilitate.

> **RUSSIAN VERSION OF THE TYCHOS BOOK !** [РУССКАЯ ВЕРСИЯ КНИГИ «ТИХОС» !]
> _July 19, 2024:_ This is to announce the release of a magnificent Russian translation of the TYCHOS book, by Alexander Pohilko. All the original English captions of the book's graphics have also been translated into Russian, making this the first ever 'fully-translated' version of the book. You may find the link to the Russian PDF above - and the hardcover version should soon become available at LULU books (watch this space).

### The TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator

**NOTE for the online readers of this book**: Before you start reading the 32 chapters of this book, I highly recommend you to open on your laptop the [TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator](https://ts.tychos.space/) and spend some time getting familiar with its functions (some basic tips and instructions can be found in [Chapter 4](https://book.tychos.space/chapters/4-intro-tychos#43-the-tychosium-3d-simulator) of this book). The TYCHOSIUM is a work in progress - but it is already the most accurate simulator of our Solar System in existence as it correctly maps the observed alignments of our planets _vis-à-vis the stars_, unlike any of its heliocentric counterparts.

### A general introduction to the TYCHOS model

The TYCHOS is a revised model of our Solar System. Its basic orbital configuration is based on the semi-Tychonian model as defined by Longomontanus in his Astronomia Danica (1622), a monumental work regarded as Tycho Brahe´s ´testament´. Although the semi-Tychonian and the TYCHOS models are geometrically similar, they significantly differ in that the latter assigns an orbit to Earth – whereas the former considers Earth as a motionless (albeit diurnally-rotating) celestial body.

The TYCHOS submits that the Sun and Mars (whose orbits, in the semi-Tychonian model, intersect) are in fact a binary system, much like the vast majority of our surrounding star systems. It is noted for pertinent comparison that the Sirius binary system is composed of two bodies (Sirius A and Sirius B) whose observed, highly unequal diameters are, proportionally-speaking, virtually identical to those of the Sun and Mars. In the TYCHOS, Earth is located at / or near the barycenter of our Sun-Mars binary duo; it rotates around its axis once daily and revolves at about 1 mph around its circular ”PVP” orbit once every 25344 solar years. ”PVP” stands for Polaris-Vega-Polaris, the two most notable ´Northern stars´ under which Earth transits in the course of its 25344-year journey, commonly-known as the ”precession of the equinoxes”.

In the TYCHOS, the Sun and Mars are both escorted by a pair of moons (Mercury & Venus and Phobos & Deimos) which are all tidally locked to their respective hosts – much as our own Moon is tidally locked to Earth. Another common trait of these five moons is their exceptionally slow rotational speeds (around their axes). Our own Moon´s synodic period is shown to be the greatest common divisor of all of our system´s celestial bodies´ orbital periods: for instance, our Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars exhibit a 1: 4: 20: 25 orbital resonance. In turn, the mean value (12.5) of this quartet (i.e. 1+4+20+25=50/4=12.5) reflects the orbital resonance between our Moon and the Sun (1: 12.5). This remarkable pattern extends to our outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which are respectively synced with our Moon´s orbital synodic period at a 1: 150: 375: 1050: 2062.5: 3100 ratio. It should be noted that these exact, multiple orbital resonances only become mathematically apparent when taking into account Earth´s 1-mph motion as posited by the TYCHOS model.

A series of longstanding (yet to this day still unsettled) riddles of astronomy are shown to be effectively resolved by the core principles of the TYCHOS model. Age-old yet extant questions such as the ”failed Michelson-Morley experiments”, James Bradley´s ”aberration of light”, the ”anomalous precession of Mercury´s perihelion”, the curious 8-shaped analemma (and our need for the ”Equation of Time”), why only Mercury and Venus have no moons, why both Mars and the Sun exhibit 79-year cycles, why Earth´s rotation appears to decelerate and its equinoctial precession to accelerate, why our main asteroid belt is located between Mars and Jupiter (and why it even exists) all find sensible and forthright answers when assessed within the holistic TYCHOS paradigm. Most significantly perhaps, the currently inexplicable so-called negative stellar parallax (exhibited by a good 25% of our stars) as well as the baffling amount of stars registering zero parallax (nearly 50%!) can be shown to be natural corollaries of the TYCHOS´ geometry. In other words, the mysterious existence of three types of stellar parallaxes (positive, negative and zero) is to be fully expected in the TYCHOS model.

Conversely, it is demonstrated that the Copernican / Keplerian model of our solar system cannot possibly represent the physical reality of our cosmos – as it violates some of the most elementary laws of perspective ruling the optical / spatial domain of our human perceptions. Various examples are provided illustrating the inherent absurdity of the current, widely-accepted heliocentric geometry, such as the observed absence of parallax between two relatively proximate bodies (e.g. Earth & Mars – or Earth & our Moon) and the distant stars – as they both supposedly (as of Copernican theory) move laterally by several million kilometers. On the other hand, such apparent aberrations of relative longitudinal perspectives – as well as other incongruities related to seasonal planetary latitudes (i.e celestial declinations) – are shown to be wholly coherent with the geometric configuration, celestial mechanics and orbital velocities propounded by the TYCHOS model. In the light of this, the TYCHOS emerges as more than just another alternative interpretation of the vast body of documented astronomical observations of our neighboring cosmos: it is today the only existing model of our Solar System consistent with empirical experience and the most consolidated realities of our physical world.
