>**WEBSITE UPDATED ! (May 2024)**
_May 4, 2024:_ This is to announce that I have now updated the website with the final (proofread, polished and revised) versions of all 32 chapters of the Tychos book, just as they are to be found in the hardcover book available at LULU (see above). This also means that you can now easily reference / hyperlink any given subchapter sections of your interest, since they all have their individual URL. Of course, one of the main purposes of this website is to stimulate online discussions about the Tychos model, something that this new feature should facilitate. 

>**RUSSIAN VERSION OF THE TYCHOS BOOK !** [РУССКАЯ ВЕРСИЯ КНИГИ «ТИХОС» !]
_July 19, 2024:_ This is to announce the release of a magnificent Russian translation of the TYCHOS book, by Alexander Pohilko. All the original English captions of the book's graphics have also been translated into Russian, making this the first ever 'fully-translated' version of the book. You may find the link to the Russian PDF below - and the hardcover version should soon be available at LULU books (watch this space).

### PDF OF THE BOOK - in English, German, Dutch and Russian

_February 5, 2024:_ Today I have decided (in the interest of maximum public diffusion) to make the full 320-page PDF of the 2nd Edition of "The TYCHOS - Our Geoaxial Binary System" **freely downloadable**. Enjoy, share and diffuse far & wide - and do kindly consider making a one-off or monthly [donation](https://book.tychos.space/please-donate) in support of the TYCHOS research, an ongoing enterprise I have pursued non-stop for over a decade - with no academic / institutional funding whatsoever. It is a work in progress and much remains to be done, such as the continuing development of the Tychosium 3D simulator (headed by my closest collaborator Patrik Holmqvist) and the translation of the book in various languages. Many thanks for your most appreciated and much-needed support.

### UPCOMING TYCHOS EVENTS

- June 15 & 16, 2024: Two-day TYCHOS event in Hertfordshire, UK (25 miles north of London). Details here: https://lawfulrebel.com/this-june-15th-presentation-of-a-groundbreaking-astronomical-discovery/

- Oct 31 - Nov 2, 2024: It is now confirmed that I will be presenting the TYCHOS model at the 3-day ["Renewal Of Science" conference](https://www.renewalofculture.org/renewalofscience) to be held at the COMPUTER HISTORY MUSEUM in Mountain View, California. To all my American friends and followers, I dearly hope to see you all there. I will be speaking **at around 1:30pm on Friday, November 1** and am currently working on a refined slideshow presentation of the TYCHOS model. Here is the [agenda of the conference](https://www.renewalofculture.org/_files/ugd/01c972_96547b8280094e09896e1b34560aac88.pdf).


*****************************************************************************************************************************

### Discuss the Tychos Model at the [TYCHOS FORUM](https://forum.tychos.space/t/welcome-to-the-tychos-forum/7)

### The TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator

**NOTE for the online readers of this book**: Before you start reading the 32 chapters of this book, I highly recommend you to open on your laptop the [TYCHOSIUM 3D simulator](https://ts.tychos.space/) and spend some time getting familiar with its functions (some basic tips and instructions can be found in [Chapter 4](https://book.tychos.space/chapters/4-intro-tychos#43-the-tychosium-3d-simulator) of this book). The TYCHOSIUM is a work in progress - but it is already the most accurate simulator of our Solar System in existence as it correctly maps the observed alignments of our planets _vis-à-vis the stars_, unlike any of its heliocentric counterparts.
