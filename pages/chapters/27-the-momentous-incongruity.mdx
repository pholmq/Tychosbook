Chapter 27: The MOMENTOUS incongruity
===========================================

Perhaps the greatest problem posed by heliocentrism is that of the minuscule Angular Momentum (AM) that our Sun exhibits - i.e. only 0.3% of our entire Solar System's _combined_ angular momentum! That is, under the paradigm of current theory - which has the Sun completing just ONE of its orbits in 240 million years or so... This issue has been debated for decades by scores of cosmologists and astrophysicists, since it constitutes a glaring contradiction of the most established and all-important laws of conservation of momentum - as defined and unanimously accepted in academic circles. It is a seemingly insuperable impasse that 'silently' keeps haunting our world's scientific community. Yet, to this day, no one has ever put forth any sensible resolution to the Sun's "AM mystery".

This persisting riddle is known in astronomy circles as the "Angular Momentum Problem". It is widely recognized and of paramount importance among cosmologists who study the so-called "formation theories" (i.e. the hypotheses of how our stars, planets, moons, etc were formed in the first place).

> _**"Angular momentum problem** : The fact that the Sun, which contains nearly all of the mass of the solar system, accounts for just 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. This is an aspect of the solar system that any acceptable formation theory must address."_
[Astrotoday glossary](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/GLOSSARY/GLOSS_A.HTM#angular%20momentum%20problem)

That's right, ladies & gents: any theory of our Solar System that doesn't address or/and fails to resolve the issue of the Sun's ludicrously small 0.3% AM is _not acceptable._ Therefore, any Newtonian advocates who may be inclined to try and falsify the TYCHOS model must _firstly_ submit an explanation for this momentous incongruity presented by Newtonian physics and by the almost universally-accepted heliocentric model.  

Here are some scholarly descriptions of the thorny Angular Momentum Problem :

> _**Solar System -The Angular Momentum Problem** "Perhaps the most important issue to be resolved in future versions of the solar nebula model is that of the distribution of angular momentum. The problem for the solar nebula theory is that it predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. In other words, the Sun should spin much more rapidly than it does. A mechanism is therefore required to transport angular momentum away from the central proto-sun and redistribute it in the outer planetary disk. One proposed transport mechanism invokes the presence of magnetic field in the nebula, while another mechanism proposed the existence of viscous stresses produced by turbulence in the nebular gas."_ ["The Angular Momentum Problem" - Science Jrank.org](https://science.jrank.org/pages/6266/Solar-System-angular-momentum-problem.html)

> _**The Angular Momentum Problem** "A possible weak link in the condensation theory is sometimes known as the angular momentum problem. Although our Sun contains about 1000 times more mass than all the planets combined, it possesses a mere 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. Jupiter, for example, has a lot more angular momentum than does our Sun—in fact, about 60 percent of the solar system's angular momentum. All told, the four jovian planets account for well over 99 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. By comparison, the lighter (and closer) terrestrial planets have negligible angular momentum. The problem here is that all mathematical models predict that the Sun should have been spinning very rapidly during the earliest epochs of the solar system and should command most of the solar system's angular momentum, basically because it contains most of the mass. However, as we have just seen, the reverse is true. Indeed, if all the planets' orbital angular momentum were transferred to the Sun, **it would spin on its axis about 100 times as fast as it does at present**."_ ["The Angular Momentum Problem" - Astrotoday](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/AT315/HTML/AT31505.HTM)

> _**The Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem** "Many hypotheses have been formulated to justify the missing angular momentum, such as the loss of solar mass due to solar radiations, solar wind and solar magnetic ﬁeld. However, as we will see below, the ejection mass due to these phenomena can not compensate for the missing angular momentum, which remains an unsolved problem to this day, as are the anomalies detected in the TNOs orbits. (...)The Sun only accounts for about 0.6% of the total angular momentum of the solar system! This result is really unexpected since nebular model predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. The problem is known as «angular momentum problem». Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this problem, but there is still no convincing theory."_ ["Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem" - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32890375/The_Planet-X_and_Angular_Momentum_Problem)

As you can see, no one knows why the currently-computed angular momentum of our Sun (which is believed to contain 1000X the mass of all the planets combined) could possibly amount to less than 1% of the combined angular momentum of our entire solar system! This humongous quandary is, incredibly enough, still up for grabs!

Moreover, it makes no sense (under current theory) that our Sun would rotate around its axis as slowly as it does - at 6670km/h (incidentally, near-exactly 4X Earth's rotational speed) whereas Jupiter, for instance, rotates at a brisk 43000km/h. Besides, it is also believed that the Sun's rotational speed is gradually slowing down; tentative attempts have been made to explain this other puzzle, yet they all appear to belong to the realm of wild speculation. As one fantastic theory goes, the Sun's spin rate would be slowed down by none other than... its own photons! ["Sun's Rotation Slowed Down by its own Photons" - New Scientist.com](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2120202-suns-rotation-is-slowed-down-by-its-own-photons/) 

As illustrated conceptually in the below graphic, the TYCHOS can show that the apparent deceleration of the Sun's axial rotation is yet another illusory reckoning by heliocentrists who, of course, are unaware of the Earth's motion around the PVP orbit.

As Copernicans use sunspots (which can last for weeks or even years) as 'reference markers' for calculating the Sun's rate of rotation, the one factor they will fail to account for is the Earth's translational motion in the opposite direction of the Sun. A given sunspot will thus appear to return slightly late to its expected celestial alignment - and they will erroneously conclude that the Sun’s rotational speed has decreased.
 
But let's return to the main topic of this chapter, namely the AM problem; ; what can we possibly do in order to resolve this momentous incongruity of the Newtonian principles? One truly cannot exaggerate the gravity of the situation (pun intended)! Are we poor souls destined to remain forever in ignorance of the physical workings of our cosmos? And is ALL of gravitational physics just a terrible mistake? Or, to put it bluntly:

**Do we have to "throw out Newton's baby - _AND_ the bath water"?**

Not necessarily. As computed by the Binary Research Institute (BRI), the mystery of the Sun’s missing angular momentum would essentially vanish - **“if only the Sun were moving in a binary orbit with a period of 24000 years**... (In the TYCHOS model, of course, the Sun revolves around an orbit with a period of 25344 years - i.e. fairly close to the BRI's value of 24000 years). The below excerpt is from a BRI article titled "Angular Momentum - Evidence":

> _"The angular momentum issue is a well documented problem that has baffled solar system formation theorists for many years.The Sun contains 99.9 % mass, but only 1% of the total Angular Momentum. Most of the remainder is typically associated with the Jovian Planets. Theoretical Physicists developing Formation Theories are thwarted by this anomalous distribution. The Binary Model provides allocations of Angular Momentum to Mass for Planets and Stars in line with common expectations. (...) Our proof here is rather compelling. We first looked at the angular momentum distribution charts (see here 60 percent of angular momentum lies with Jupiter). We then ran the formulas ourselves with existing inputs to make sure the textbook data was correct. Everything checked out. Next, is the same chart in an “Angular Momentum to Mass ratio” formula. You can see all the bodies in our solar system have ratios in line with their mass except for the Sun (see chart at BRI website - Ed). We then added one input into the existing formula: we assumed the Sun was moving in a binary orbit with a period of 24,000 years (see chart at BRI website - Ed). As you can see, the Sun came right into line. This indicates the Sun may indeed have it’s proper angular momentum (proportional to it’s mass) providing another indication our sun is part of a binary or multiple star system."_ ["Angular Momentum - Evidence" / BRI](http://binaryresearchinstitute.com/bri/evidence/angular-momentum/)

In short, the Binary Research Institute's working thesis concerning the missing angular momentum of the Sun can be summarized as follows: if we assume that the Sun is moving in a binary orbit with a period of ca. 24000 years, it would then turn out to have the proper & expected - or in any case, a far less disproportionate - angular momentum (AM) in accordance with its mass. This is of course in line with what the TYCHOS model proposes: a binary orbit of the Sun of ca. 24000y (or more precisely 25344 y).  

In conclusion, the vexing issue of the Sun’s missing angular momentum (an inescapable problem haunting this world's scientific community) is not going away. For the supporters of heliocentrism and Newtonian physics - and no matter what excuses they will concoct to try and 'deflect' it's importance - this severe incongruity will remain an outright embarrassment. Conversely, under the TYCHOS paradigm, this "pesky mystery" would not only completely disappear - but it may even help in rescuing Newtonian physics from its own contradictions. In the TYCHOS, there simply is _no_ missing angular momentum of the Sun and there is, consequently, _no_ mystery whatsoever in need to be resolved. In the TYCHOS, the Sun has just about the right angular momentum that Newtonian physics would expect - since the Sun has a reasonably short "local" orbit (as opposed to a gigantic, 240-million-year orbit). Its orbit intersects that of its binary companion Mars - much like all the binary stars in our universe. However, since this is not even remotely considered by heliocentric astronomers, they have become entrapped by their very own belief system. 

The following three chapters will be concerned with three different types of celestial bodies (a STAR, an ASTEROID and a COMET). As we shall see, their observed motions in our skies are not only perfectly consistent with the TYCHOS model - but can also be used to falsify the Copernican / heliocentric model. In fact, all three of these different celestial bodies corroborate the tenets of the TYCHOS model, each one in its own way. 

- Barnard's **STAR** - the fastest-moving star in our skies, and our next-to-nearmost star system.

- The Eros **ASTEROID** - the very first NEA (Near-Earth Asteroid) ever discovered.

- Halley's **COMET** - by far the most famous comet of all.
