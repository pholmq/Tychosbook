Chapter 27: The MOMENTOUS incongruity
===========================================

### 27.1 The glaring angular momentum problem

Perhaps the greatest problem posed by heliocentrism is that of the minuscule angular momentum (AM) of our Sun, which would amount to only 0.3% (or less) of the entire system’s combined AM, according to the currently favored paradigm, which has the Sun completing one orbit in 240 million years or so. The issue has been debated for decades by scores of cosmologists and astrophysicists since it constitutes a flagrant contradiction of the laws of conservation of momentum unanimously accepted in academic circles, and is like an impasse ‘silently’ haunting the scientific community. In fact, no one has ever put forth a sensible resolution to the ‘angular momentum problem’, as it is known in astronomy circles.

This persisting riddle is widely recognized and of paramount importance among cosmologists who occupy themselves with the so-called ‘formation theories’ which attempt to model the evolution of celestial bodies.

> _**"Angular momentum problem** : The fact that the Sun, which contains nearly all of the mass of the solar system, accounts for just 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. This is an aspect of the solar system that any acceptable formation theory must address."_ [Astrotoday glossary](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/GLOSSARY/GLOSS_A.HTM#angular%20momentum%20problem)

I would argue that any model or theory of our Solar System that fails to account for the Sun’s ludicrously small angular momentum is futile and unacceptable. Thus, Newtonian advocates looking to falsify the TYCHOS model should first submit an explanation for this momentous incongruity which afflicts Newtonian physics and the heliocentric model. 

> _**Solar System -The Angular Momentum Problem** "Perhaps the most important issue to be resolved in future versions of the solar nebula model is that of the distribution of angular momentum. The problem for the solar nebula theory is that it predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. In other words, the Sun should spin much more rapidly than it does. A mechanism is therefore required to transport angular momentum away from the central proto-sun and redistribute it in the outer planetary disk. One proposed transport mechanism invokes the presence of magnetic field in the nebula, while another mechanism proposed the existence of viscous stresses produced by turbulence in the nebular gas."_ ["The Angular Momentum Problem" - Science Jrank.org](https://science.jrank.org/pages/6266/Solar-System-angular-momentum-problem.html)

> _**The Angular Momentum Problem** "A possible weak link in the condensation theory is sometimes known as the angular momentum problem. Although our Sun contains about 1000 times more mass than all the planets combined, it possesses a mere 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. Jupiter, for example, has a lot more angular momentum than does our Sun—in fact, about 60 percent of the solar system's angular momentum. All told, the four jovian planets account for well over 99 percent of the total angular momentum of the solar system. By comparison, the lighter (and closer) terrestrial planets have negligible angular momentum. The problem here is that all mathematical models predict that the Sun should have been spinning very rapidly during the earliest epochs of the solar system and should command most of the solar system's angular momentum, basically because it contains most of the mass. However, as we have just seen, the reverse is true. Indeed, if all the planets' orbital angular momentum were transferred to the Sun, **it would spin on its axis about 100 times as fast as it does at present**."_ ["The Angular Momentum Problem" - Astrotoday](https://lifeng.lamost.org/courses/astrotoday/CHAISSON/AT315/HTML/AT31505.HTM)

> _**The Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem** "Many hypotheses have been formulated to justify the missing angular momentum, such as the loss of solar mass due to solar radiations, solar wind and solar magnetic ﬁeld. However, as we will see below, the ejection mass due to these phenomena can not compensate for the missing angular momentum, which remains an unsolved problem to this day, as are the anomalies detected in the TNOs orbits. (...) The Sun only accounts for about 0.6% of the total angular momentum of the solar system! This result is really unexpected since nebular model predicts that most of the mass and angular momentum should be in the Sun. The problem is known as «angular momentum problem». Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this problem, but there is still no convincing theory."_ ["Planet-X and Angular Momentum Problem" - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/32890375/The_Planet-X_and_Angular_Momentum_Problem)

As shown by the academic citations above, no one knows why the currently computed angular momentum of our Sun, which is believed to have 1000 times the mass of all the planets combined, could possibly amount to less than 1% of the system’s total angular momentum. Moreover, it makes no sense under the heliocentric paradigm that our Sun would rotate around its axis as slowly as it does (6670 km/h, near-exactly 4 times Earth’s rotational speed), whereas Jupiter, for instance, rotates at a brisk 43000 km/h. Besides, the Sun’s rotational speed is also said to be decreasing, but nothing but wild speculation has been offered to explain this observation. One fantastic theory even posits that the Sun’s spin rate is _“slowed down by its own photons”!_ ["Sun's Rotation Slowed Down by its own Photons" - New Scientist.com](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2120202-suns-rotation-is-slowed-down-by-its-own-photons/) 

As illustrated conceptually in Figure 27.1, the TYCHOS model can readily show that the apparent deceleration of the Sun’s axial rotation is yet another optical illusion confounding heliocentrists unaware of the Earth’s motion around the PVP orbit.

**Fig. 27.1** As Copernican astronomers use sunspots, some of which can last for weeks or even years, as ‘reference markers’ to determine the Sun’s rate of rotation, the one factor they will fail to account for is the Earth’s translational motion in the opposite direction of the Sun. A given sunspot observed over time will thus appear to return to its celestial alignment slightly later than expected, leading astronomers to erroneously conclude that the Sun’s rotational speed has decreased.

### 27.2 The TYCHOS puts an end to the AM problem
 
But, returning to the AM problem, one truly cannot exaggerate the gravity of this Newtonian predicament (pun intended). Is all gravitational physics in error? Can we throw out the Newtonian baby and still keep the bathwater? Perhaps. According to the Binary Research Institute (BRI), the ‘mystery’ of the Sun’s missing angular momentum would essentially vanish _“if only the Sun were moving in a binary orbit with a period of 24000 years”._ In the TYCHOS model, a full 360° equinoctial precession is completed in 25344 years, which is fairly close to the figure used in the BRI’s calculations.

> _"**Angular Momentum - Evidence*:*The angular momentum issue is a well documented problem that has baffled solar system formation theorists for many years. The Sun contains 99.9% mass, but only 1% of the total Angular Momentum. Most of the remainder is typically associated with the Jovian Planets. Theoretical Physicists developing Formation Theories are thwarted by this anomalous distribution. The Binary Model provides allocations of Angular Momentum to Mass for Planets and Stars in line with common expectations. [...] Our proof here is rather compelling. We first looked at the angular momentum distribution charts (see here 60 percent of angular momentum lies with Jupiter). We then ran the formulas ourselves with existing inputs to make sure the textbook data was correct. Everything checked out (see chart at BRI website - Ed). Next, is the same chart in an “Angular Momentum to Mass ratio” formula. You can see all the bodies in our solar system have ratios in line with their mass except for the Sun. We then added one input into the existing formula: we assumed the Sun was moving in a binary orbit with a period of 24,000 years (see chart at BRI website - Ed). As you can see, the Sun came right into line. This indicates the Sun may indeed have its proper angular momentum (proportional to its mass) providing another indication our sun is part of a binary or multiple star system.

The BRI’s working thesis concerning the missing angular momentum of the Sun can be summarized thus: if the Sun were moving in a binary orbit with a period of around 24000 years, its observed angular momentum would be compatible with, or at least far less disproportionate to, its estimated mass. Consequently, critics claiming that _“the TYCHOS model violates Newtonian physics”_ should first provide a congruent solution to the widely acknowledged AM conundrum. Failing that, the only honest and truly scientific thing to do is to discard the unphysical Copernican model. 

The vexing issue of the Sun’s missing angular momentum is not going away, no matter what excuses are dreamed up or how hard heliocentrists try to make us believe the matter was settled long ago. Interestingly, the TYCHOS paradigm not only completely dissipates this pesky ‘mystery’ but may even help rescue Newtonian physics from its own contradictions. In the TYCHOS, the Sun has just about the amount of angular momentum predicted by Newtonian physics, considering its reasonably short ‘local’ orbit, rather than the gigantic, 240 million-year orbit posited by heliocentrists. The Sun’s orbit intersects that of its binary companion, Mars, as observed in all binary systems, but this essential fact is not even remotely considered by astronomers entrapped in the Copernican belief system.

The following three chapters will be concerned with three different types of celestial bodies: stars, asteroids and comets. As we shall see, their observed motions in our skies are not only perfectly consistent with the TYCHOS model but can also be used to falsify heliocentrism. In fact, all three types of celestial bodies corroborate the tenets of the TYCHOS model, each one in its own way.
