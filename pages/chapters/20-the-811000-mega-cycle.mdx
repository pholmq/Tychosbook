Chapter 20: The 811000-year Mega Cycle
========================================================

**Agreement between simulators**

As we saw in Chapter 16, our Solar System appears to have a long cycle of 811000 years, at both ends of which the members of the ‘inner group’ (the Sun, Mars, Mercury, Venus, the Earth and the Moon) are found in almost the exact same celestial positions, something you can verify for yourself in the Tychosium 3D simulator. The question is: why would this be?

Before we proceed any further, I would like to address a question I am sure many readers have on their minds: when it comes to very long periods and cycles, does the Tychosium 3D simulator agree with the other simulators ‘on the market’? It is not a simple question to answer. The geoheliocentric layout of the TYCHOS model naturally sets the Tychosium 3D simulator apart from heliocentric simulators but, truth be said, the latter all disagree with one another to some extent. However, one particular simulator—the JS Orrery—is of special interest to the TYCHOS model because of its somewhat similar graphic construct and layout. The man credited with providing the exacting algorithms and ephemeride tables for the JS Orrery happens to be Paul Schlyter, a veteran Swedish astronomer and staunch heliocentrist with whom Patrik Holmqvist (the developer of the Tychosium 3D simulator) and I have had an extensive e-mail exchange. According to Schlyter, the Tychosium will never attain to the level of accuracy of the JS Orrery; it is, in fact, doomed to fail.

To put that dire prediction to the test, let us compare the two simulators for accuracy over a long period. Unfortunately, the JS Orrery does not allow to enter dates as remote as 811000 years, so we shall restrict our test to a time span of some twenty thousand years. The below screenshots from the two respective simulators compare the relative positions of the Sun, Mars, Earth, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter on two dates 23429 years apart:

As you can see, the two simulators are in excellent agreement over a period of more than 23000 years. Patrik Holmqvist and I are now satisfied that the Tychosium 3D simulator is at least as reliable at predicting secular planetary positions as any of the most popular heliocentric Solar System simulators. And, more importantly, the Tychosium can do so while fully respecting the optical perspective of the observed conjunctions _between our planets and the stars_, unlike any existing heliocentric simulator—including the JS Orrery.   

## The 811000-year cycle of our Solar System and the Sirius System 

In Chapter 6, I speculated about the possibility of the Sirius System being the “double-double” binary companion of our Solar System. It is probably no fluke that the Sun reaches its apogee in the first days of July, as it aligns longitudinally with Sirius as seen from Earth. As the 811000-year cycle gradually came to light in the course of my decade-long research efforts, I finally decided to put to this theory to the test – using what is currently known about Sirius (through its observational data and predicted celestial motions). Sirius is observed to move towards our Solar System and is expected to become our South Pole star in roughly 60000 years from now. The problem with this prediction is that, if Sirius were to be as distant as 8.6 light years and moving towards us - as officially estimated - at a radial velocity of 5.5 km/s, it would employ more than 469000 years to reach the “X vector” perpendicular to our Solar System’s ecliptic. Clearly, the official predictions do not add up - and something else must be going on. For the purpose of my research though, I chose to use that “60000-year” prediction (for Sirius becoming our South Pole star) as computed by the famed mathematical astronomer Jean Meeus.   

Now, if the Sirius system were to be our Solar System’s binary companion, we would expect it to display a ‘long binary orbit’ the same size as ours. Hence, for my geometric experiment, I chose to draw two equally-sized ‘wheels’ (intersecting in classic binary fashion) representing the long binary orbits of Sirius and our Solar System. Assuming their 'full secular cycle' to be 811000 years, I animated their motions in 16 steps of 50688 years. Incidentally, and as you may recall from Chapter 16, 50688 years (i.e. 2 X 25344) is the “Great Year of Mars”. 

The outcome of this experiment―however speculative it may be―makes for an interesting hypothesis: our Solar System and the Sirius System would complete what we may call a ‘mega cycle’ and return to the same relative positions in about 811000 years. Moreover, as predicted by Jean Meeus, Sirius would indeed become our southern pole star roughly 60000 years from now (or somewhat earlier, around the year 53000). Note that, on several occasions in the course of this 811000-year cycle, Sirius will pass much closer to us than it is today.

The many independent researchers who have proposed that Sirius is the binary companion of the Sun may well have been correct all along. Note also how this may go to elucidate the existence of the mysterious 405-kyr cycle already discussed in Chapter 16. It bears reminding that this peculiar long period (405000 ± 500 years) has been identified by scores of multidisciplinary scientists as a significant ‘metronome’ regulating a number of cyclical events in the realms of geology, geodynamics, dendochronology, climatology and paleomagnetism. [According to Milankovitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles), the major component of the variations of the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit occurs, interestingly enough, with a period of 405000 years. The below graphic shows how our Solar System and the Sirius System will 'swap sides' (at 180°) over a 405500-year period, suggesting that some sort of long-term magnetic reversal might be at play.

Inquiring readers may now wish to compare the above graphic with Figure 16.5 (see Chapter 16). In the latter, we saw that all the ‘inner bodies’ of our system return to the same place in 405500 years, with the sole exception of our Moon which will ‘swap sides’ (at 180°) at the midpoint of the 811000-year Mega Cycle (360°). This would conceptually seem to reaffirm our Moon’s role as the ‘central driveshaft’ of the entire system (see Chapter 13).

Perhaps the most astounding aspect of the 811000-year Mega Cycle is how it appears to regulate even our comets’ and asteroids’ secular / millennial motions: as can be verified in the Tychosium simulator, asteroid Eros, for instance, returns to the same place in our skies in exactly 811000 years―whereas Halley’s comet returns to the same place in our skies in exactly 1 622 000 years (i.e. 811000 x 2, a period we may call the “Double Mega Cycle”). You may wish to verify this by perusing the Tychosium simulator: you will simply have to activate “Halley” in the “Planets” menu, then set the date of the simulator to 1986-04-10 (the latest passage of Halley’s comet) and the comet will appear close to the Earth. Next, enter the date 1623986-04-10 (i.e. 1 622 000 years later) and―“boom”―the comet will reappear in the same place as it was in 1986.

And here comes the ‘cherry on the Mega Cycle cake’; you may probably have wondered about our so-called ‘outer planets’ (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune); don’t they also follow the 811000-year cycle, much like our ‘inner planets’? Yes, Neptune does but, incredibly enough, the other three all obey to the Double Mega Cycle of 1 622 000 years, just like Halley’s comet! It is hard to fathom the scope and significance of all this, yet it certainly suggests that cosmologists and astrophysicists need to undertake a major rethink of their current understanding of celestial mechanics.  

  

## The TYCHOS and the magnetic pole reversals of the Sun and Earth 

The so-called 'magnetic pole reversals' of the Sun and the Earth are a subject of much debate and popular fascination. Yet, no firm explanation has been proposed to this day as to the causality of these magnetic reversals, nor much less as to the diverse rates at which they occur. The TYCHOS model, short of explaining exactly why these reversals take place, provides nonetheless a compelling proposition which would account - quantitatively - for the vastly different periods of magnetic reversals of the Sun (ca. 11.5 years) and the Earth (ca. 800000 years). 

![](https://septclues.com/TYCHOS/PoleReversal_01.jpg)
Above: A classic illustration of the pole reversal concept

Let us first take a brief look at the Sun’s 'magnetic field reversal' period - as of the official reckoning :

_"During what is known as the solar cycle, the magnetic field of the Sun has reversed every 11 years over the past centuries. This flip, where the south magnetic pole switches to north and vice versa, occurs during the peak of each solar cycle and originates from a process called a “dynamo”. Magnetic fields are generated by a dynamo, which involves the rotation of the star as well as convection and the rising and falling of hot gas in the star’s interior."_ ["3D simulations reveals why the Sun flips its magnetic field every 11 years" - Smithsonian](https://tinyurl.com/sunflipSMITHSONIAN)

So the Sun’s magnetic field, we are told, reverses in the very short period of 11 years. However, this is not an exact value since this period can vary from 9 to 14 years:

_“Most people think of the solar cycle as having a fixed length of 11 years. This is not strictly true as cycles vary considerably in length from as little as 9 years to almost 14 years.”_ ["The Length of the Solar Cycle"](https://www.sws.bom.gov.au/Educational/2/3/7) 

It should therefore be more correct to say that the mean of this solar cycle amounts to about **11.5** years (9+14=23/2=11.5).

Do scientists have any clue as to why this solar cycle exists? Well, no:

_“If you’re confused about the sun’s impending magnetic field flip, don’t feel bad — scientists don’t fully understand it, either. The sun’s magnetic field will reverse its polarity three or four months from now, researchers say, just as it does every 11 years at the peak of the solar activity cycle. While solar physicists know enough about this strange phenomenon to predict when it will occur, its ultimate causes remain mysterious.”_ ["What Causes the Sun’s Magnetic Field Flip?"](https://www.space.com/22310-sun-magnetic-field-flip-mystery.html) 

In Chapter 16, we saw that the most recent geomagnetic reversal of the Earth’s poles occurred roughly 800000 years ago. More precisely, what is known as the "Brunhes-Matuyama reversal" is reckoned to have occurred 781000 years ago.

In the TYCHOS model, the Earth’s orbital speed (1.601169 km/h) is a mere 0.00149326% of the Sun’s orbital speed (107226 km/h). So let’s see how this pans out mathematically - with regards to the respective magnetic reversal periods of the Sun and the Earth:

0.00149326% of 781000 years amounts to ≈ **11.6624** years 

In other words, it would appear that the magnetic reversals of the Sun and the Earth are regulated by - and are commensurate to - their respective orbital speeds! Another way to express this astonishing relationship would be: 

- Earth's orbital speed is 66967.3 X slower than the Sun's orbital speed (107226 / 1.601169 ≈ 66967.3)
- Earth's magnetic reversals occur 66967.3 X less frequently than those of the Sun (781000 y / 11.6624 y ≈ 66967.3)

This sort of remarkable realization is, of course, only possible when viewed through the 'TYCHOS lens'. To be sure, no 'heliocentric' thesis has ever been attempted to account for the vastly different recurrence rates of the Earth's and the Sun's magnetic reversals; in absence of any official explanation for their respective periodicities, one may say that the TYCHOS model "wins by default", much like when a basketball team fails to show up at a tournament... In the next chapter we shall take a further look into aspects related to the motions of the Earth and the Sun, with particular regards to the optical implications of the same - as viewed from an earthly frame of reference.
