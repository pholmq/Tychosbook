Chapter 18: Uranus, Neptune & Pluto prove the PVP orbit
=====================================================

### 18.1 Introduction 

According to official astronomy data, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit around us in a trifle less than 84, 165 and 248 years, respectively. The fact that each of these orbital periods fall just short of integer numbers of years may not seem significant at first sight, but there is a very good reason for it.

According to a [NASA fact sheet by D.R. Williams](https://www.tychos.info/citation/128A_Planet-fact.htm): 

Uranus has an orbital period of 30589 days, or ~83.74 years (a trifle less than 84 years)

Neptune has an orbital period of 60182 days, or ~164.77 years (a trifle less than 165 years)

Pluto has an orbital period of 90560 days, or ~247.94 years (a trifle less than 248 years)

In the TYCHOS, the true orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto can be shown to be precisely 84, 165 and 248 years, respectively. The reason they will appear to an earthly observer to be slightly shorter is the parallax effect caused by Earth’s motion around its 25344-year PVP orbit. What follows will demonstrate that these parallax effects neatly reflect, and are commensurate with, Earth’s motion. 


### 18.2 Uranus in the TYCHOS

	•  True orbital period of Uranus in the TYCHOS: precisely 84 solar years

	•  Displacement of the Earth over 84 years: 14036 km x 84 ≈ 1 179 024 km 

	•  1 179 024 km amounts to 0.3314% of 355 724 597 km (the PVP orbit’s circumference)

	•  84 years correspond to 0.3314% of the TGY of 25344 solar years

	• 0.3314% of 1440 min (the full celestial sphere) amounts to ~4.7 min of RA.

And in fact, every 84 years Uranus appears to precess against the stars by about 4.5 min of RA. Hence, we may infer that this is just a parallax effect caused by Earth’s motion along the PVP orbit over that same 84-year period. Figure 18.1 provides an example: in the 84 years between 2016-10-15 and 2100-10-15, Uranus will appear to ‘drift eastwards’ by 4.5min (from 1h24min to 1h28.5min of RA):

**Fig. 18.1** In 84 years, Uranus returns to the same place in the sky. Yet, due to Earth’s motion (over 84 years) it will appear— as viewed from Earth— to have moved ‘eastwards’ by about 4.5 min of RA in relation to the stars. 

In other words, Uranus’ true orbital period is 84 years exactly, not 83.74 years as officially reckoned. The discrepancy disappears when taking into account the Earth’s motion around its PVP orbit.

### 18.3 Neptune in the TYCHOS

 	•  True orbital period of Neptune in the TYCHOS: precisely 165 solar years

	•  Displacement of the Earth over 165 years: 14036 km x 165 ≈ 2 315 940 km

	•  2 315 940 km km amounts to 0.651% of 355 724 597 km (the PVP orbit’s circumference)

	•  165 years correspond to 0.651% of the TGY of 25344 solar years

	• 0.651% of 1440 min (the full celestial sphere) amounts to ~9.4 min of RA. 

And in fact, every 165 years Neptune appears to precess against the stars by about 10 min of RA. Hence, we may infer that this is just a parallax effect caused by Earth’s motion along the PVP orbit over that same 165-year period. Figure 18.2 provides an example: in the 165 years between 2017-09-05 and 2182-09-05, Neptune will appear to ‘drift eastwards’ by 10min (from 22h58min to 23h08 min of RA):

**Fig. 18.2** In 165 years, Neptune returns to the same place in the sky. Yet, due to Earth’s motion (over 165 years) it will appear— as viewed from Earth— to have moved ‘eastwards’ by about 10 min of RA in relation to the stars.  

In other words, Neptune’s true orbital period is 165 years exactly, not 164.77 years as officially reckoned. The discrepancy disappears when taking into account the Earth’s motion around its PVP orbit.

### 18.4 Pluto in the TYCHOS

	•  True orbital period of Pluto in the TYCHOS: precisely 248 solar years

	•  Displacement of the Earth over 248 years: 14036 km x 248 ≈ 3 480 928 km

	•  3 480 928 km amounts to 0.978% of 355 724 597 km (the PVP orbit’s circumference)

	•  248 years correspond to 0.978% of the TGY of 25344 solar years

	• 0.978% of 1440 min (the full celestial sphere) amounts to ~14min of RA. 

And in fact, every 248 years Pluto appears to precess against the stars by approximately 13 ± 1 min of RA on average. Hence, we may infer that this is just a parallax effect caused by Earth’s motion along the PVP orbit over that same 248-year period. Figure 18.3 shows that in the 248 years between 1941-10-28 and 2189-10-28, Pluto will appear to ‘drift eastwards’ by almost 13 min (from 8h37min to 8h49.4min of RA):

**Fig. 18.3** Pluto returns to the same place in the sky in 248 years. Yet, Joe will see Pluto displaced vis-à-vis the background stars, since ` Earth has, in the meantime, moved along at 1.6km/h (covering a distance of 3 480 928 km). This optical effect is called ‘parallax’.

In conclusion, the true orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are, just like those of all the other bodies in our system, exact integer multiples of the TMSP and, of course, of the solar year. All the apparent ‘secular precession’ of these planets in relation to the stars is simply parallax caused by the Earth’s 1.6 km/h motion around its PVP orbit, as this chapter has plainly demonstrated.

Our Solar System is a most remarkable ‘clockwork’. The orbital periods of all its components are simply multiples of the orbital cycles of the Moon and the Sun. Sadly, this awe-inspiring harmony has gone unnoticed since the adoption of the heliocentric model. What should have been perceived as perfectly predictable motions and natural optical phenomena have been turned into imaginary ‘inequalities’, ‘anomalies’, ‘perturbations’, ‘turbulences’, ‘gravitational or non-gravitational effects’, and random ‘chaotic’ behaviours. 

Entire lifetimes have been spent by Copernican astronomers in intricate calculi and numerical integrations, in a hopeless quest to make sense of what is empirically observed in our skies. Clutching onto their heliocentric convictions, their battle has always been a losing one. In light of this, the TYCHOS model should come as a welcome relief to astronomers, cosmologists and astrophysicists alike, were it only for saving them untold amounts of time and toil.

(Note: the screenshots used in this chapter are from the now defunct NEAVE planetarium, but the respective ephemerides given for Uranus, Neptune and Pluto can be all verified perusing the online Stellarium simulator as well as the Tychosium 3D simulator).
