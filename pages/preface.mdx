Foreword
===================================


This book is a sincere and well thought through effort to present the true configuration of our Solar System. With an easily readable style, Simon Shack makes the complexities of astronomy accessible to the lay person by guiding the reader through the subject in a refreshingly logical and informative way.
He first identifies that the heliocentric model of the solar system, widely accredited to Nicolaus Copernicus, is geometrically impossible. With simple geometry and elementary mathematics, the contradictions are revealed. You will be introduced to the many fudge-factors and the questionable reasoning that have been used to explain away anomalies and contradictions over the centuries. He then demonstrates that none of these are necessary in his alternative model. The TYCHOS is fully consistent with all of the empirical observations performed throughout the centuries, without any contradictions. Logically speaking, this is very powerful evidence of its correspondence to reality.

In short, he shows that our planet does not revolve around the Sun. But instead, it is located at the center of a binary system comprised of the Sun and Mars. These move around each other in what are described as intersecting orbits. At the same time, the Sun orbits the Earth, while all the other planets orbit the Sun. All the while, the Earth moves at a relative snail’s pace spinning its way around its own 25344-year orbit.

The basis of this configuration was first proposed in the 16th century by Tycho Brahe, the most rigorous and prolific observational astronomer of all times. Curiously, his work is often either ignored or unfairly disparaged. Using his meticulously observed data, Tycho Brahe inferred that the Sun and Mars move around each other in a manner that we would identify today as a binary pair. Binary star systems were unknown in the 16th Century, since the telescope had not yet been invented. Simon Shack confidently began with Brahe’s proposed system (though rejecting its geostationary component) for the simple reason that the vast majority of visible star systems are now telescopically observed to be binary. He then added his own idea of the Earth’s PVP orbit in a fantastic feat of conceptual integration that accommodates and explains the precession of the equinoxes, and many other phenomena in what can be considered the final piece of the puzzle. This work also methodically demonstrates how the basic principles of the TYCHOS are strongly supported by numerous modern astronomical discoveries which have been either overlooked, misinterpreted, or perhaps even willfully ignored by the world’s scientific community. 

It is crucial for any serious investigator of truth to separate the most fundamental question of ‘what is it?’ from the logically subsequent question of ‘how does it work?’ First, we must identify what we are looking at. We must ask questions such as ‘what shape is it’, and ‘how does it move’, to first establish identity. Only then can we proceed to address the question of how it works and what forces might cause its structure and motion. It is therefore necessary to put aside considerations of how the planetary motions are achieved, such as Newton’s theory of gravity, and refrain from using this theory as reason to doubt the nature of an integrated and consistent model of what can be observed in the night sky.

It is often claimed that the ideas of men possessing no conventionally recognised qualifications can be dismissed out of hand, but this is both illogical and disingenuous. It is the evidence and the rational argument that should be the focus of investigation. Scientific method regards falsification of a theory as an essential means to increasing the certainty of what is claimed as truth. Anomalies and contradictions with any theory are the red warning flags of error. They are the signal that assumptions must be questioned and that a metaphorical ‘return to the drawing board’ is required. Yet many experts and astronomers routinely shrug off anomalies and contradictions. They find it hard to question the assumptions of previous generations precisely because their qualification is the sum of all those assumptions made to date. Simon Shack is a scientifically minded researcher who is not similarly encumbered with reluctance to go ‘back’ down to the metaphorical basement and revisit those most fundamental assumptions. He can ask the forbidden questions and is armed with the essential tools to answer them; curiosity, an ability to think logically, and a keen interest in the subject matter. He is both intellectually qualified and intellectually free.

In 2018 Simon presented the first draft of his book to Swedish software developer and IT specialist Patrik Holmqvist. Patrik made computer simulations of the proposed TYCHOS model that later became the Tychosium 3D - the first simulator of our Solar System whose geometric configuration correctly replicates the empirically observed celestial positions of our planets in relation to the stars. He later commented: _“I figured that somewhere along the road, some insurmountable problems with the model would inevitably surface.” But this hasn't been the case. So far, step by step, all observations, experiments and cross-verifications have confirmed the TYCHOS model's validity.”_

In our bankrupt western culture, innovation has become stifled and genuine scientific advancement effectively thwarted. Simon's book and Patrik’s Tychosium 3D simulator provide a valuable resource for astronomers and researchers across the world. This work represents an inspirational return to rational thinking and presents what I consider to be a truly historical step forward in our understanding of the solar system. 

As you dive into the TYCHOS, I encourage you to peruse the Tychosium 3D simulator (linked in [Chapter 4](https://book.tychos.space/chapters/4-intro-tychos)) and spend time getting familiar with its functions. It’s a great tool to help visualize, comprehend and appreciate the awesome geometric beauty of our binary Solar System along with its spirographic, mandala-like orbital patterns. Enjoy your journey into what I believe is the most reasonable and factually accurate interpretation of our Solar System ever devised.
