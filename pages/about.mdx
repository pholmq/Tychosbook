About the Author
==============


I am the (lone) author of this new interpretation of our Solar System - based on both ancient and recent cosmological theorems and astronomical observations. I am an independent researcher with no ties or affiliation with any entity whatsoever and have conducted this decade-long study in perfect solitude, on a zero budget. I feel fortunate to have no academic credentials to speak of, as this ‘handicap’ may have facilitated what I had ideally set out to do ever since day one; namely, to perform a fresh and unprejudiced investigation into the realm of astronomy - free from any preconceptions, entrenched doctrines or dogmatic beliefs. 

I’m a 50%-50% Norwegian/Swede currently living near Rome (italy) with my dog, Mira.

For any questions you might have with regards to the TYCHOS model (or related matters), feel free to contact me by personal e-mail at simonshack(at)libero.it – or to join the [Tychos discussion Forum](https://forum.tychos.space/). I will do my best to reply to each and every message as time permits. However, if you are to submit any elaborate arguments or critique with regards to the validity of the TYCHOS model, please make sure to first read the full book! I am a modest yet passionate and communicative type of person - and am very much open to debate the TYCHOS with allcomers - whether they be laypersons or members of this world’s scientific community. 

Starting from March 2022, I will be available for speeches and audiovisual / slide presentations of the TYCHOS model anywhere on this tranquil planet for a fair / adequate fee + travel expenses. Languages spoken are English, French, Italian, Swedish and Norwegian.
